# Hand Sign Detection

A Python-based **Hand Sign Detection** system that uses computer vision and machine learning to recognize hand gestures in real-time using a webcam.  
This project can be used for gesture-based control systems, sign language interpretation, and interactive applications.

---

## ðŸš€ Features
- Real-time hand sign detection using webcam.
- Detects and classifies multiple predefined hand signs.
- Uses **OpenCV** for image processing.
- Trains a machine learning model from captured dataset.
- Easy-to-use and adaptable for different gesture sets.

## ðŸ›  Tech Stack
- **Python 3.x**
- **OpenCV**
- **NumPy**
- **TensorFlow / Keras** (for model training)
- **Scikit-learn**
- **Matplotlib** (for visualization)
